# OperantParadigmAnalysis-Python
This repository will contain python scripts for analyzing output from MEDAssociates Operant Chambers. Stephanie will be rewriting analysis code that she had written (self-taught, so full of anti-patterns and inefficient) in MatLab, which outputs behavioral measures of interests from time and event code strings.
The first goal will be to write scripts for each paradigm, which analyze a single animal's run.
The second goal will be to extend the scripts to analyze multiple animals across days.
The final goal will be to graph the computed analysis.

# Paradigms
#### Trough Train (1 and 2)
#### Continuous Reinforcement Schedule (CRF)
#### Random Ratio and Random Interval (possibly could use CRF script)
#### Operant Sensation Seeking
#### Conditioned Inhibition
#### Pavlovian Cue Elicited Responding
#### Go/No-Go
#### Progressive Ratio
#### Differential Reinforcement of Low Rate 
#### Visualization of Session
